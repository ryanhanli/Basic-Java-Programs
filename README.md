# Basic-Java-Programs

Java programs I developed in my free time.  
What is in this repository so far:
1. Yahoo Finance Web Scraper

Simple Yahoo Finance program that allows a user to input the name/abbreviation of a stock, commodity, foreign currency, and etc. and check their updated price(according to Yahoo Finance) in real time.

2. Forex Session Tracker

Program acts as a virtual forex clock helps traders keep track of the different Forex trading sessions. The program tells one exactly what trading sessions they're in and if there's an overlap currently happening between two sessions. It will automatically adjust to the user's time zone.

3. AutoClicker(MouseBot and MouseBotInvoker)

Mouse bot that left clicks based on the user's input of clicks and delay between clicks.  Utilizes Java's built-in Robot Class.
