# Basic-Java-Programs

Java programs I developed in my free time.  
What is in this repository:
1. Yahoo Finance Web Scraper
-Simple Yahoo Finance program that allows a user to input the name/abbreviation of a stock, commodity, foreign currency, and etc. and check their updated price in real time.  Can be tweaked to take in a large number of inputs and sort them by their P/E ratio for later use.
